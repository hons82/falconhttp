# FalconHTTP

*falconhttp* is an implementation of a http web server. Or to be more precise it contains multiple different implementations of possible server techniques.

These are at the moment:

- simple
- fork
- thread
- IO-multiplexing

This web server is not (yet :-P ) intended to be ever used within a productive environment, so no warranty in any form can be given.

It is just for educational purposes to show the different versions in action. So download it, study it and change it however you like.
